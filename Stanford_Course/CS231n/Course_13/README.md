# Note of Course 13.(Generative Models)

## Unsupervised learning.
- Autoencoders: feature representation, through reconstructing input data.
- density estimation.
- Generative models
	- Given training data, generate new samples from same distribution.
	- Addresses density estimation, a core problem in unsupervised learning.
	- Explicit density estimation: explicityly define and solve for p
	- or implicit density estimation: learn model that can sample from p  without explicitly define the p.
