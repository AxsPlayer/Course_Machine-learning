# Note of Course 2.

## Image classification.
- The most common problem in computer vision. 
- The challenges is: 
	- One is the viewpoint variation, meaning if image changes a little, the pixels matrix will be totally different.
	- Another one is the illumination, light will be different.
	- Another one is the deformation, the different pose of animal, for example.
	- Background Clutter.
	- Intraclass.

## Classifier.
- First classifier: Nearest Neighbor. It's the easiest method to try at first and you can try different kind of distance. Different distance means different boundary.
