# Note of Course 14.(Efficient Methods and Hardware for Deep Learning)

## Model problems.
- The first challenge: Model Size.
- The second challenge: speed.
- The third challenge: Energy Efficiency.
- algorithm and hardware co-designed.

## Solutions.
- Number representation.

## Algorithms for efficient inference.
- Pruning
	- prune the network weights
	- 90% parameters are not useful for accuracy
- Weight Sharing
	- class the weights and represent centroid.
	- huffman coding.
- SqueezeNet: compress the convolutional layer.
- Quantization
- Low Rank Approximation
- Binary / Ternary Net
- Winograd Transformation
