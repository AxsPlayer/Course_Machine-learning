# Note of Course 5.(Convolutional Neural Networks)

## Convolutional layer.
- The early layer learns the simple feature of the image, like the edge of the things.

## Stride.
- The size of stride should follow some formula. Not all kind of size can be a-plied to the network.
- In practice: Common to zera pad the boarder.

## Pooling layer.
- downsample the neural network for FC layer to reduce the parameter for overfitting problem.
