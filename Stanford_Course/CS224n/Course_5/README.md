# Note of Course 5.

## FastText Method.
Using average of word vectors to represent sentence vector, and using hierarchical softmax to deal with the unbalanced classes problem, the FastText method is faster than Neural Network Method, which always takes few days to train, and FastText only takes few seconds.

## Some Advice.
- Set baseline for your project.
Using simple models to set a baseline for your project, not only for model performance score, but also for correctness for data split and so on so forth,
