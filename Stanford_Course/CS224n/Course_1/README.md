## Why is NLP hard?
- Complexity in representing, learning and using linguistict/situational/world/visual knowledge
- Human languages are ambiguous(unlike programming and other formal languages)
- [Most Difficulty Point]: Human language interpretation depends on real world common sense, and contextual knowledge.(which means conversation is designed to convey meanings as efficient as possible, thus the conversation will discard some common sense and hope listener will fill in the rest or the underlying words or meanings)
- Different people have different understanding to the same sentence.
