## The disadvantage of RNN.
- Recurrent neural nets cannot capture phrases without prefix context, and often capture too much of last words in final vector. (If you just wanna keep track of several certain words, but RNN would go through all the sentence and mix all the context information with target phrases.)
- Thatâ€™s why use CNN to resolve the problem.

## Main CNN idea.
- What if we compute vectors for every possible phrase? Regardless of whether phrase is grammatical or not very linguistically or cognitively plausible.
- Advantage: compute parallel.

## History of CNN in NLP.
- Single layer CNN: The filter is vector to sum up several word vectors to CNN layer.
