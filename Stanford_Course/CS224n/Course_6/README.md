## Language analysis.
There are two ways to analyze the structure of natural languages.
- Constituency context-free grammar(Phrase structure grammar) viewpoint: The first way is to conclude the grammar for each kind of language.
- Dependency grammar viewpoint: The second way is to analyze every sentences’ dependency tree structure. The disadvantages are that this method takes a lot of labor and seems slower than prior. But the advantages are that it’s reusable for the upstreaming works, it shows the frequencies and distributional information, and it’s also a good way to evaluate systems for the labeled ones could be ground truth.
In syntactic representations, the dependency grammar wins.
