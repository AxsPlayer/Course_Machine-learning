## Target of task?
This project is designed to build the simplest **Deep Neural Network** with one latent layer to classify the Pics of digitals 
into suitable category.

## Claims.
The most of code in file is copied from book's example. The only thing changed is just structure of code in order to 
make the code more readable, as well as some 'small' trick of Python Grammer.
