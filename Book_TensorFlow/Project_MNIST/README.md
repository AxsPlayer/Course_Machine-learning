# Target of task?
This project is the 'Hello Word' program in TensorFlow, which is necessary for green-hand to learn some basic grammer 
and to know how to run a TensorFlow-based project smoothly.

## Claims.
The most of code in file is copied from book's example. The only thing changed is just structure of code in order to 
make the code more readable, as well as some 'small' trick of Python Grammer.
